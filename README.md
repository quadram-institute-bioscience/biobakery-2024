The "BioBakery" suite is a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing microbial communities, including taxonomic, functional, and strain-level profiling ([Beghini 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.19.388223).
Two key components of this suite are **MetaPhlAn** and **HUMAnN**. 
MetaPhlAn is a tool for taxonomic profiling that uses clade-specific marker genes to assign reads to microbial clades ([Segata 2012](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2066)). 
HUMAnN, on the other hand, is a method for inferring the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome ([Abubucker 2012](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002358)). 

Both tools have been further developed and improved, with MetaPhlAn 4 integrating information from metagenome assemblies and microbial isolate genomes for more comprehensive taxonomic profiling ([Blanco-M√≠guez 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.22.504593), [2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-01688-w)), and HUMAnN3 enabling fast, accurate, and species-resolved functional profiling ([Franzosa 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30531976/)). 
These tools are available as part of the "BioBakery" suite, which is actively maintained and publicly available for local installation ([McIver 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx754)).
